If you don't have time to contribute, please at least reach out and give us some feedback on the library by posting in the [v2 audio thread](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v2-audio/53535) or contact us via PM [@baz](https://forums.fast.ai/u/baz/) or [@madeupmasters](https://forums.fast.ai/u/MadeUpMasters/)\n",

    "\n",
    "### How to submit a PR\n",
    "The first step to create a new PR is to install `jupyter notebook` or `jupyterlab`. This library is build using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), meaning that all of the code, documentation and test is written into notebooks, and the `.py` python files, online docs and CI tests are created by nbdev based on those notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the files that you will change are present into the `nbs/` folder. Your general workflow while developing will be:\n",
    "* Open the notebooks using jupyter\n",
    "* Change what is present\n",
    "* Save the file\n",
    "* Run `make` and nbdev will update the library files, documentation and run the tests all at once\n",
    "* Check if any errors occured while running the last step, then fix it and run `make` again\n",
    "* Commit the changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced PR tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* The command `nbdev_diff_nbs` can let you know if there is a difference between the local library and the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you made a change to the notebooks in one of the exported cells, you can update the library with `nbdev_build_lib` or `make fastai2`. Note that this command will only update the library code, so before any commit, you'll need to run `make` as usual to update the docs and run the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you made a change to the library, you can export it back to the notebooks with `nbdev_update_lib`."
